# Song Generator

A small Python project for training a simple song/lyrics generation model and then generating new text from it.

This repo is organized as a lightweight pipeline:
1) preprocess / clean text data  
2) train a model  
3) generate new samples from a prompt or seed

> Note: The exact dataset format and hyperparameters are defined in the code. If you change your dataset location or naming, you’ll likely only need to adjust `train.py` / `data_processing.py`.

## Project structure

- `data_processing.py`  
  Utilities for loading, cleaning, and preparing the dataset for training.

- `model.py`  
  Model definition (the architecture lives here).

- `train.py`  
  Training script: builds the dataset, trains the model, and saves artifacts (weights, tokenizer/vocab, etc.).

- `generate.py`  
  Inference script: loads the saved artifacts and generates new text.

- `main.py`  
  Convenience entry point (typically used to run train/generate from one place).

- `requirements.txt`  
  Python dependencies.
